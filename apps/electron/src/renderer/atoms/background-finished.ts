/**
 * Jotai atom for the "background session finished" appearance preference.
 *
 * When a session running in the background finishes while the user is viewing a
 * different session, an in-app chip surfaces that completion in the chat input's
 * top-right corner — the in-app complement to the OS notification, which only
 * fires when the whole app is unfocused. This atom gates whether that chip is shown.
 *
 * It's an appearance *preference*, so it persists to localStorage via
 * `atomWithStorage` — reactive, multi-window, no RPC/disk-config. The value is read in two
 * places (the App-level completion detector and the chat-view render gate), which
 * is exactly what a persisted atom is for. Per-machine, not workspace-synced.
 *
 * The chip's transient runtime state — the queue of finished sessions plus its
 * push/dismiss action atoms — lives below the preference. The queue is a plain
 * (non-persisted) atom: a "you missed this" signal that should not survive a
 * reload.
